WebElemental is a small library to make writing Selenium tests easier.

WebElemental introduces the Element class, which works with an API modeled on jQuery.
This means that web tests can be written in a way that is familiar to those used to CSS selectors and jQuery.

There are several key motivations for the creation of this library:</p>

 * It is often just as necessary to verify the absence of elements as the presence of them - this is something that is challenging with the WebDriver interface
 * When using the http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects being bound to specific data can often make tests quite fragile. This has led to constructs such as Element.any() and Element.first()
 * Selection of elements is most naturally performed using CSS selectors by Web Developers - Selenium places equal weight on Xpath selection, which experience has shown tends to be more fragile.
